								<b>Background</b> <br> Hi and thank you for getting to know me! I'm originally from Orange Country but grew up in Las Vegas (colloquially the 9th island of Hawai'i!), so am very happy to be back under the sun in Hawai'i after four cold years of college in New York. When I'm not doing research or school work, you can find me hiking, skateboarding, eating, or (most likely) doting on my rescue kitten Calcifer. I also dabble in drawing and tattooing, just for fun.

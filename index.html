								<b>Background</b> <br> Hi and thank you for visiting my page to get to know me! I'm originally from Orange Country, California but grew up in Las Vegas, Nevada (colloquially the 9th island of Hawai'i!). I'm very happy to be back under the sun in Hawai'i after four (cold) years of college in New York. When I'm not doing academic things, you can find me hiking, skateboarding, eating, or (most likely) doting on my rescue kitten Calcifer. I also dabble in drawing and tattooing, just for fun. One of my biggest influences and roles models in life is my sister, <a href="https://janehjlee.github.io">Jane</a>, who is also working toward a PhD!

								<b>Research Interests</b> <br> I'm broadly interested in all things star-planet interactions. I primarily study stellar rotation, multiplicity, and activity of young M dwarfs, as well as the disks and planetary systems around them. I use IR spectrographs on Mauna Kea to look for binary systems, measure radial velocities, and measure magnetic field strengths.

								I'm very committed to increasing access and equity from primary to post-secondary education. While at Vassar College, I was largely involved in the <a href="https://www.vassar.edu/vassar-education-collaboration">Vassar Education Collaboration</a> (f.k.a. Vassar College Urban Education Initiative), volunteering to mentor middle and high school students in Dutchess County. Now in Hawai'i, I'm mentoring high school students in astronomy projects, in addition to public outreach and education events. 
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Outreach</b> <br>
								- Every summer, I work as a <a href="https://home.ifa.hawaii.edu/outreach/histar-2//">HI-STAR</a> Astronomy Summer Camp Mentor <br>
								- I also regularly volunteer for <a href="https://home.ifa.hawaii.edu/outreach/">Institute for Astronomy</a> outreach events, such as Open House (pictured above), stargazing nights, etc.<br>
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>DEI</b> <br>
								- I am a graduate student representative on the Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (JEDI) Committee in the Earth and Planetary Sciences department at UH (2021-22).<br>
  								- I also am a <a href="https://www.questbridge.org/">QuestBridge</a> Finalist Alum and Volunteer. I'm very intent on reqcruiting more students to apply to the QuestBridge National College Match, especially those facing intersectional barriers to higher education beyond financial strain.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Grad Student Resources</b> <br>
								- <b>NSF GRFP:</b> There are many useful graduate student resources publicly available for applying to the NSF GRFP; I particularly liked <a href="https://www.alexhunterlang.com/nsf-fellowship">Alex Lang's</a>, where I have volunteered my <a href="LEE_NSF/Lee GRFP Personal Draft.pdf" target="_blank">personal statement</a>, research proposal, and feedback in their spreadsheet of <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xoezGhbtcpg3BvNdag2F5dTQM-Xl2EELUgAfG1eUg0s/edit#gid=0">successful examples.</a><br>
  								- I keep a (somewhat irregularly updated) spreadsheet of <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dygZE7NP3dGEq-g8tnExF_i3Y3yHcbCZryi4beTEZlg/edit?usp=sharing">Scholarships and Fellowships</a> that pertain to graduate students at large, astronomy grads, and students in Hawai'i. Eligibilities vary, but it's a good running list of possible funding sources and awards for students like me. If you have any suggestions or questions, let me know!

							<p>
								Calcifer is my rescue kitten. He was born in October 2021 in the streets of Ewa along with five siblings, who were all abandoned by their parents. A fellow graduate student fostered them, and one day we all got a random email from her offering up free kittens. I was immediately drawn to Cal's unique eyes. At first, I didn't think I could handle such a young kitten, so I convinced my friends to adopt him (so I could selfishly play with him without any responsibility). When we went to meet him and his siblings, he ran into my arms and I just couldn't let him go, so the friends ended up adopting one of his sisters and I got Cal. He is extremely clingy, cuddly, and playful, in my opinion much more so than most cats. Even as I am setting up this website, he is laying on my arm and making it difficult to type. He always greets me with loud meows after a day at the office, and won't sleep at night unless I'm next to him. He is also a surprisingly good hunter. To my dismay, he has gifted me a live B52 cockroach and small bird before. I suppose he's still an alley cat at heart.
